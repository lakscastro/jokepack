# Jokepack

This App list jokes from [sv443.net API](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/)

_Note:_ I'm using this project just to learn [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

> ## Still in development, but the App is [available to download](https://github.com/LaksCastro/jokepack/releases/download/v0.1.0/app-release.apk)

## Disclaimer

Note: due to the different types of humor, JokeAPI contains a wide variety of jokes, of which some are very offensive. They can be filtered out, but use this API at your own risk!
